This is certainly more fun than I had expected, in this post I will be shortly guiding you to the amazing MDX **_(that X in here is for React-Components)_** features and also custom MDX components that I can use to compose those interesting blog posts that I do rarely write 😂

#### _Alright Let's start with basics then~_

Here is a simple example of a footnote<Footnote id={1} text="Reference to the resource that provides information about a topic" /> that you might use in your blog posts.
You can add cited text pointing to a source.<Footnote id={2} text="Short summary about the source" />
Also, you can add the link to the source you are reffering to and<Footnote id={3} text="This reference is accompained with a link pointing to the external source" link="https://example.com" /> you might have use in your blog posts.

### Formatting

#### Heading Level 4

### Heading Level 3

## Heading Level 2

# Heading Level 1

<u>This is how underlined text looks like</u>

**This is how bold text looks like**

_This is how italic text looks like_

~~This is how strikethrough looks like~~

#### Ordered List

### Table

Tables are useful for presenting structured data in a clear, organized manner. Here's an example of a table I use to display various levels of experience, learning appetite, project sizes, and solutions:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: [
      "Experience Level",
      "Learning Appetite",
      "Project/Team Size",
      "Recommended Solution",
    ],
    rows: [
      ["Beginner", "Low", "Small", "useState"],
      ["Beginner", "Medium", "Small to Medium", "useContext + useReducer"],
      ["Intermediate", "High", "Large", "Redux Toolkit"],
      ["Advanced", "High", "Medium to Large", "Jotai, Valtio"],
      ["Advanced", "High", "Large", "Recoil (or Relay for GraphQL)"],
    ],
  }}
/>

### Pro-Con Cards

<ProConsComparison
  pros={[
    "SSR boosts SEO and performance.",
    "SSG enables faster page loads.",
    "Built-in routing and API routes.",
    "Automatic code splitting.",
    "Strong TypeScript support.",
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Complex setup for large apps.",
    "Frequent updates need maintenance.",
    "Steep learning curve for advanced features.",
    "SSR increases server load.",
    "Third-party tools dependency.",
  ]}
/>

### Inline Code

`HashMap<Integer, String>`

`SELECT Count(*) FROM users`

`float x=9.99`

`const func=() => {}`

### Code Block

```jsx
import React from "react";
const Greeting = () => {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }, []);
  return <div>Check the console for a greeting!</div>;
};
export default Greeting;
```

### Live Code

Live code allows interactive code snippets and their outputs directly in my webpage. Here's an interactive MDX editor that demonstrates the power of mixing markdown with React components:

<LiveCode
  mode="preview"
  fileNames={["MDXDemo.js", "MDXComponents.js"]}
  template="react"
/>

<Callout emoji="💡">
  **Callout:** Alright this block is a callout block to highlight essential
  information that readers shouldn't overlook. Below is how the tweet card looks
  like.
</Callout>
