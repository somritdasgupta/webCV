This is certainly more fun than I had expected, in this post I will be shortly guiding you to the amazing MDX **_(that X in here is for React-Components)_** features and also custom MDX components that I can use to compose those interesting blog posts that I do rarely write üòÇ

#### _Alright Let's start with basics then~_

Here is a simple example of a footnote<Footnote id={1} text="Reference to the resource that provides information about a topic" /> that you might use in your blog posts.
You can add cited text pointing to a source.<Footnote id={2} text="Short summary about the source" />
Also, you can add the link to the source you are reffering to and<Footnote id={3} text="This reference is accompained with a link pointing to the external source" link="https://example.com" /> you might have use in your blog posts.

### Formatting

#### Heading Level 4

### Heading Level 3

## Heading Level 2

### Table

Tables are useful for presenting structured data in a clear, organized manner. Here‚Äôs an example of a table I use to display various levels of experience, learning appetite, project sizes, and solutions:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: [
      "Experience Level",
      "Learning Appetite",
      "Project/Team Size",
      "Recommended Solution",
    ],
    rows: [
      ["Beginner", "Low", "Small", "useState"],
      ["Beginner", "Medium", "Small to Medium", "useContext + useReducer"],
      ["Intermediate", "High", "Large", "Redux Toolkit"],
      ["Advanced", "High", "Medium to Large", "Jotai, Valtio"],
      ["Advanced", "High", "Large", "Recoil (or Relay for GraphQL)"],
    ],
  }}
/>

### Pro-Con Cards

<ProConsComparison
  pros={[
    "SSR boosts SEO and performance.",
    "SSG enables faster page loads.",
    "Built-in routing and API routes.",
    "Automatic code splitting.",
    "Strong TypeScript support.",
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Complex setup for large apps.",
    "Frequent updates need maintenance.",
    "Steep learning curve for advanced features.",
    "SSR increases server load.",

/>

### Inline Code

`HashMap<Integer, String>`

`SELECT Count(*) FROM users`

`float x=9.99`

`const func=() => {}`

### Code Block

```jsx
import React from "react";
const Greeting = () => {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }, []);
  return <div>Check the console for a greeting!</div>;
};
export default Greeting;
```

### Live Code

Live code allows interactive code snippets and their outputs directly in my webpage. Here‚Äôs how I use a live code block with the Angular template:

<LiveCode mode="preview" fileName={["App.js"]} template="angular" />

### Tweet Card

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  **Callout:** Alright this block is a callout block to highlight essential
  information that readers shouldn‚Äôt overlook. Below is how the tweet card looks
  like.
</Callout>

<StaticTweet id="1505668279678824448" />
